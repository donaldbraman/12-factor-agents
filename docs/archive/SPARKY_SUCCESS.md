## 🎯 The Moment of Truth

**At 20:29 UTC on September 18, 2025, SPARKY's first PR was merged.**

This marks the beginning of truly autonomous issue resolution - from problem identification to merged solution, all automated by a lean, focused system following 12-factor agent principles.

**SPARKY isn't just a tool - it's a philosophy:**
- Keep it simple
- Own your abstractions
- Delete more than you add
- Focus on results
