# Lean Agent Pattern

## Summary

We successfully refactored the bloated 1387-line IntelligentIssueAgent into three specialized, lean agents totaling just 264 lines - an **81% reduction** in code complexity.

## The Problem

The original `IntelligentIssueAgent` had become a monolithic beast:
- 1387 lines of code
- 57 methods
- Complex state management
- Hardcoded business logic
- Difficult to maintain and understand

## The Solution: Lean, Prompt-Driven Agents

Following the 12-factor agent principles, we created:

### 1. **BugFixAgent** (82 lines)
- Single responsibility: Fix bugs
- Logic in prompts, not code
- Simple and focused

### 2. **FeatureBuilderAgent** (74 lines)  
- Single responsibility: Build features
- Prompt-driven architecture design
- Clean separation of concerns

### 3. **IssueRouter** (108 lines)
- Routes issues to appropriate agent
- Simple classification logic
- No complex orchestration

## Key Principles Applied

### Factor 2: Own Your Prompts
- All decision logic moved to prompt templates
- Agents become thin orchestration layers
- Easy to modify behavior without code changes

### DELETE MORE THAN YOU ADD
- Removed 1123 lines of unnecessary complexity
- Each agent under 110 lines
- Total codebase 81% smaller

### Persona-Driven Design
- Each agent has a specific persona/role
- No mixing of responsibilities
- Clear, understandable purpose

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each agent is simple enough to understand in minutes
2. **Flexibility**: Change behavior by editing prompts, not code
3. **Testing**: Small, focused units are easier to test
4. **Onboarding**: New developers can understand the system quickly
5. **Performance**: Less code to load and execute

## Comparison

```
Old: IntelligentIssueAgent   1387 lines
New: Three lean agents         264 lines
-----------------------------------------
Reduction:                     81% (1123 lines deleted)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complexity creeps in** - Regular refactoring is essential
2. **Prompts > Code** - Let LLMs handle complex logic through prompts
3. **Specialization wins** - Multiple simple agents beat one complex agent
4. **Delete aggressively** - If it's not essential, remove it

## Next Steps

1. Migrate remaining complex agents to lean pattern
2. Create prompt testing framework
3. Build prompt versioning system
4. Document prompt best practices
