# 12-Factor Agents

## Overview

A systematic approach to building reliable AI agents using stateless function patterns and existing tools. This project implements the 12-factor methodology for agent systems, maximizing Claude's capabilities while minimizing custom code complexity.

## Architecture

Based on the key insight that **Claude agents are stateless functions, not persistent services**, this system uses:

- **Stateless Functions**: Replace complex classes with simple functions
- **Smart Orchestration**: Move complexity to orchestration layer
- **Existing Tools**: Leverage built-in capabilities over custom frameworks
- **Simple Patterns**: Python stdlib over external dependencies

## Available Agents

- **SmartIssueAgent**: Universal issue handler with automatic complexity detection
- **RepositorySetupAgent**: Sets up repository structure and configuration
- **PromptManagementAgent**: Manages prompt templates and versioning
- **EventSystemAgent**: Handles event triggers and automation
- **IssueFixerAgent**: Fixes bugs and implements simple features
- **TestingAgent**: Runs validation and tests using simple patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: `uv run setup.sh`
2. **Test**: `uv run python core/simple_testing.py`
3. **Run Agent**: `uv run python agents/smart_issue_agent.py`

## Core Components

- `core/` - Simple, stateless core functionality
- `agents/` - Individual agent implementations
- `prompts/` - File-based prompt templates
- `docs/` - Architecture and implementation guides

## Key Features

### Simple Testing Framework
```python
from core.simple_testing import quick_test

def test_my_function():
    assert my_function(5) == 10

quick_test("My function works", test_my_function)
```

### File-Based Prompts
```python
from core.simple_prompts import format_prompt

prompt = format_prompt("agents/issue_analyzer", 
                      issue_title="Fix bug", 
                      issue_body="Something is broken")
```

### Git-Based Transactions
```python
from core.simple_transactions import SimpleTransactionManager

with SimpleTransactionManager().transaction("Fix issue"):
    # Changes are automatically rolled back on failure
    modify_files()
```

## Design Principles

1. **Maximize Claude, Minimize Code** - Use Claude's natural capabilities
2. **Stateless Functions** - No persistent state between calls
3. **Existing Tools First** - Leverage Python stdlib and git
4. **Simple Patterns** - Avoid over-engineering and complex frameworks
5. **Reliable Execution** - Timeout protection and error handling

## Issues Resolved

This architecture has systematically resolved 9+ critical issues including:

- File destruction bugs → Safe file operations
- Test suite hanging → Timeout-protected testing
- Complex agents failing → Simple stateless functions
- Poor logging → Structured Python logging
- No validation → Pre-commit hook integration
- Missing prompts → File-based template system

## Known Validator Limitations

The 12-factor compliance validators are comprehensive but have some known limitations that may cause false negatives:

### Factor 2: Own Your Prompts (70% typical)
**False Negative**: Detects environment variable fallback strings as "hardcoded"
- Example: `os.getenv("PROMPT_START", "Starting: {task}")` 
- The fallback string is flagged even though it's a best practice
- **Reality**: Agents using PromptManager with fallbacks ARE compliant

### Factor 7: Contact Humans with Tool Calls (75% possible)
**Validation Issue**: May not recognize all valid tool patterns
- Tools that return ToolResponse and have proper error handling may still score <100%
- Validator has overly specific expectations about implementation details
- **Reality**: If human interaction tools exist and work, the agent IS compliant

### Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents (improved)
**Inheritance Counting**: Previously counted ALL methods including inherited from BaseAgent
- An agent with only 15 own methods would show ~30-50 total methods
- BaseAgent provides ~20 necessary framework methods
- **Reality**: Agents with <20 own methods ARE properly focused
- **Status**: Fixed to only count agent's own methods

### Factor 11: Trigger from Anywhere (naming sensitivity)
**Method Naming**: Validator looks for specific method names
- Fixed to recognize both `get_triggers()` and `get_trigger_info()`
- May not recognize other valid documentation method names
- **Reality**: If trigger documentation exists, the agent IS compliant

## Practical Compliance

Due to these limitations, consider:
- **90%+ compliance**: Excellent, essentially fully compliant
- **85-90% compliance**: Very good, likely has only validator false negatives
- **80-85% compliance**: Good, may have minor real issues or multiple false negatives
- **<80% compliance**: Needs improvement in actual compliance

The validators are guides to help ensure best practices, not absolute arbiters of code quality.

## Contributing

All changes follow the proven pattern:
1. Identify existing tools that solve the problem
2. Build minimal wrapper using Python stdlib
3. Leverage Claude's natural capabilities  
4. Avoid custom frameworks and complexity
