# Chaos Test: Concurrent Resource Conflicts

## Type
bug

## Description
Fix critical resource contention where multiple SPARKY agents compete for the same files, database connections, and Git locks simultaneously. System must gracefully handle concurrent access without corruption.

## Current State
- 5 SPARKY agents launched simultaneously on related issues
- Git repository locked by agent #1, agents #2-5 waiting indefinitely
- Database connection pool exhausted (max 10, 12 requested)
- File system conflicts on shared config files
- 3 agents in deadlock waiting for resources held by others
- Memory leak from unclosed connections
- Test environment contamination between agents

## Expected Behavior
All agents complete successfully with proper resource coordination.

## Constraints
- Must handle 5 concurrent SPARKY agents
- Limited database connections (10 max)
- Single Git repository lock
- Shared file system state
- 4GB memory limit across all agents
- No agent should wait >30 seconds for resources
- Agents may have overlapping file dependencies

## Success Criteria
1. All 5 agents complete without deadlock
2. No data corruption or race conditions
3. Memory usage stays under 4GB total
4. Git operations are atomic and ordered
5. Database connections properly pooled
6. File locks released on agent completion/failure
7. Clean resource cleanup on agent crash

## Chaos Factors
- Random agent start delays (0-5 seconds)
- Simulated database connection failures (20% chance)
- Git operation timeouts (15 second limit)
- Memory pressure simulation at 80% capacity
- File lock contention on 3 shared config files
- Network delays for remote Git operations (1-10 seconds)
- Agent crash simulation (10% chance per agent)
