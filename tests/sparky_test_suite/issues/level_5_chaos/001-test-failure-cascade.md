# Chaos Test: Test Failure Cascade

## Type
bug

## Description
Fix failing authentication system where initial test failures trigger cascade of secondary failures. System state becomes inconsistent between test runs.

## Current State
- Primary auth test fails (token validation)
- Session cleanup test fails due to orphaned tokens
- Integration tests fail due to bad auth state
- Database consistency tests fail
- Performance tests timeout due to hung connections

## Expected Behavior
All tests pass with clean state isolation.

## Constraints
- Must handle 47 failing tests across 6 test suites
- Multiple test runners may be executing simultaneously
- Database may be in inconsistent state
- Some failures are transient (race conditions)
- Some failures are permanent (logic errors)

## Success Criteria
1. Identify root cause vs secondary failures
2. Fix tests in dependency order
3. All 47 tests pass consistently
4. No test state leakage between runs
5. Performance regression < 5%

## Chaos Factors
- Simulated test failures: 47 initial, 23 after first fix, 8 after second fix, 0 after final fix
- Random test runner delays (0.1s to 3s)
- 30% chance of database connection timeout on first attempt
- Race condition simulation in 3 auth tests
