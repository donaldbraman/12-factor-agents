# Chaos Test: Memory Pressure Fragmentation

## Type
bug

## Description
Fix memory exhaustion and fragmentation where SPARKY agents consume excessive memory during large codebase analysis. System must implement memory-efficient processing, garbage collection optimization, and memory pressure handling.

## Current State
- Memory usage climbing from 500MB to 8GB during execution
- Python garbage collection stalled on large object graphs
- Context windows consuming 2GB+ per analysis cycle
- Memory fragmentation preventing allocation of large blocks
- Swap usage at 100% causing system slowdown
- Out-of-memory kills terminating agents mid-execution
- Memory leaks in state persistence and learning engine

## Expected Behavior
Agent completes analysis within 2GB memory limit with efficient resource usage.

## Constraints
- Hard memory limit: 2GB per agent process
- Large codebase analysis: 50,000+ files, 10M+ lines
- Context optimization must preserve quality
- Garbage collection pauses < 100ms
- Memory pressure detection required
- No external memory optimization tools
- Agent must handle memory exhaustion gracefully

## Success Criteria
1. Stay within 2GB memory limit throughout execution
2. Process large codebase without memory exhaustion
3. Implement incremental analysis for memory efficiency
4. Optimize context window management
5. Handle memory pressure with graceful degradation
6. Memory leak detection and prevention
7. Efficient state serialization under memory pressure

## Chaos Factors
- Random memory pressure simulation (50-90% usage)
- Simulated memory leaks in analysis components
- Large file processing (files up to 100MB)
- Fragment memory pool before agent start
- Random garbage collection delays
- Memory allocation failures at critical points
- System memory pressure from external processes
