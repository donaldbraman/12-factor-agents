# Chaos Test: API Rate Limit Cascade

## Type
bug

## Description
Fix cascading failures when LLM API rate limits trigger across multiple SPARKY agents. System must implement intelligent backoff, request prioritization, and graceful degradation without losing execution context.

## Current State
- 8 SPARKY agents hitting Anthropic API simultaneously
- Rate limit exceeded: 429 responses for 12 minutes
- 5 agents stuck in retry loops with exponential backoff
- 3 agents failed with timeout after 30 minute wait
- Request queue backing up (200+ pending requests)
- Memory leak from accumulated retry contexts
- Learning engine disabled due to API unavailability
- Critical path agents blocked by non-critical requests

## Expected Behavior
All agents coordinate API usage and complete successfully within resource limits.

## Constraints
- API rate limit: 5 requests/minute per account
- 8 concurrent SPARKY agents requiring API access
- Critical vs non-critical request prioritization needed
- Maximum 45 minute total execution time per agent
- Shared rate limit pool across all agents
- No local LLM fallback available
- API downtime windows up to 15 minutes

## Success Criteria
1. Implement intelligent request queuing and prioritization
2. All agents complete within 45 minute window
3. No agent fails due to API unavailability
4. Critical requests processed before non-critical
5. Graceful degradation when API unavailable
6. Memory efficient retry mechanism
7. Fair resource allocation across agents

## Chaos Factors
- Random API rate limit enforcement (5-15 req/min)
- Simulated API downtime windows (5-15 minutes)
- Variable response latency (0.5-30 seconds)
- Request payload size limits (random enforcement)
- Authentication failures (2% chance)
- Network timeouts during critical requests
- API quota exhaustion mid-execution
