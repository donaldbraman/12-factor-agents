## Bug Report:
{issue_content}

## Fix Generation Rules:

1. **Minimal changes**: Fix only what's broken
2. **Preserve behavior**: Don't change unrelated functionality  
3. **Add tests**: Include test to verify fix
4. **Clear comments**: Explain why the fix works

## Response Format:
Provide the fix as a series of file edits:
```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.py",
      "operation": "replace",
      "old_code": "buggy code here",
      "new_code": "fixed code here",
      "explanation": "why this fixes it"
    }
  ],
  "tests": [
    {
      "file": "tests/test_fix.py",
      "test_code": "test that verifies the fix"
    }
  ]
