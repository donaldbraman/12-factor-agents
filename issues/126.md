# Sister Repo: Sparky routing bug fixes to wrong agent

## Description
Issue #136 (data integrity bug fix) was routed to IntelligentIssueAgent instead of IssueFixerAgent, causing method signature error. Agent routing recommendations are ignored.

## Details

**Source:** cite-assist  
**Priority:** high

**Error Details:**
```
IntelligentIssueAgent._handle_complex_issue() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

**Root Cause:**
- Bug fixes should route to IssueFixerAgent
- Current routing logic ignores agent recommendations
- All issues default to IntelligentIssueAgent regardless of type

**Expected Behavior:**
- Bug fixes should automatically route to IssueFixerAgent
- Agent routing recommendations should be respected
- Method signatures should be compatible across agents
