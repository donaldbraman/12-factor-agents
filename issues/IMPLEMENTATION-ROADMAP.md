# 12-Factor Compliance Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary
Systematic implementation plan to achieve 100% 12-factor compliance for the agent system.

## Current State
- **Compliance**: ~42% (4 of 12 factors)
- **Major Issues**: 8 missing validators, hardcoded prompts, oversized agents
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks to full compliance

## Implementation Waves

### ðŸŒŠ Wave 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Build core validation infrastructure

**Priority Issues**:
1. #007h: Factor 12 Validator (Stateless) - *Start here*
2. #007b: Factor 4 Validator (Structured Outputs)
3. #007e: Factor 8 Validator (Control Flow)
4. #010: Standardize ToolResponse
5. #012: @stateless decorator

**Why this order**: 
- Factor 12 (stateless) is architectural foundation
- Factor 4 (outputs) affects all tools
- Factor 8 (control) affects agent structure

### ðŸŒŠ Wave 2: Validators (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Complete all validation infrastructure

**Remaining Validators**:
- #007a: Factor 3 (Context Window)
- #007c: Factor 5 (Unified State)
- #007d: Factor 7 (Human Contact)
- #007f: Factor 9 (Error Compaction)
- #007g: Factor 11 (Trigger Anywhere)

**Parallel Work**: These can be implemented simultaneously by different developers

### ðŸŒŠ Wave 3: Cleanup (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Fix existing violations

**Refactoring Issues**:
1. #008: Externalize prompts (Factor 2)
2. #009: Compact errors (Factor 9)
3. #011: Split large agents (Factor 10)

**Order matters**: 
- Externalize prompts first (easiest)
- Then compact errors (medium complexity)
- Finally split agents (most complex)

### ðŸŒŠ Wave 4: Polish (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Achieve and maintain 100% compliance

**Final Tasks**:
- Create compliance dashboard
- Add CI/CD compliance checks
- Write best practices documentation
- Generate compliance reports

## Quick Wins (Do First!)
These can be done immediately with minimal effort:
1. Add `# noqa` comments where needed (30 min)
2. Create prompts/ directory structure (1 hour)
3. Set up basic compliance test (2 hours)

## Complexity Assessment

### Low Complexity (1-2 hours each)
- Creating validator shells
- Setting up directory structures
- Basic documentation

### Medium Complexity (4-8 hours each)
- Implementing individual validators
- Externalizing prompts
- Standardizing tool responses

### High Complexity (1-2 days each)
- Splitting large agents
- Implementing stateless validation
- Creating unified state management

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation**: 
- Feature branches for all work
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Gradual rollout

### Risk 2: Performance Impact
**Mitigation**:
- Benchmark before/after
- Profile critical paths
- Optimize hot spots

### Risk 3: Developer Confusion
**Mitigation**:
- Clear documentation
- Example implementations
- Pair programming sessions

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Week 1: 60% compliance (7/12 factors)
- [ ] Week 2: 80% compliance (10/12 factors)
- [ ] Week 3: 95% compliance (all factors, some violations)
- [ ] Week 4: 100% compliance (all factors, no violations)

## Team Assignment Suggestions
- **Senior Dev**: Factor 12 (Stateless) and Factor 4 (Outputs)
- **Mid-Level Dev**: Validators for Factors 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
- **Junior Dev**: Prompt externalization, documentation
- **All**: Code reviews and testing

## Daily Checklist
- [ ] Run compliance audit
- [ ] Check for new violations
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review PRs
- [ ] Update this roadmap

## Command Reference
```bash
# Full compliance audit
uv run python core/compliance.py audit

# Check specific agent
uv run python core/compliance.py check agents/smart_issue_agent.py

# Validate all agents
uv run python scripts/validate_all_agents.py

# Run compliance tests
uv run pytest tests/test_*_compliance.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Assign team members to waves
3. Set up tracking dashboard
4. Begin Wave 1 implementation
