# Issue #113: No Rollback Mechanism for Failed Operations

## Problem
When operations fail midway through execution, there's no way to rollback partial changes. This leaves the system in an inconsistent state with partially completed work.

## Current Behavior
- Failed orchestrations leave partial file changes
- Sub-issues are created even when parent task fails
- No cleanup of incomplete operations
- State persists even after failures
- No transaction-like behavior

## Expected Behavior
- Atomic operations - all or nothing
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Cleanup of partial changes
- State restoration to pre-operation condition
- Transaction log for recovery

## Impact
- Corrupted codebases after failed runs
- Orphaned sub-issues cluttering the system
- Manual cleanup required after failures
- Difficult to retry operations cleanly

## Implementation Ideas
- Implement transaction wrapper for operations
- Create backup/snapshot before changes
- Track all modifications for reversal
- Add rollback methods to each agent
- Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions

## Files Affected
- `core/hierarchical_orchestrator.py` - Transaction support
- `agents/smart_issue_agent.py` - Rollback logic
- `core/agent.py` - Base rollback interface
- `core/state_manager.py` - State snapshots

## Priority
HIGH - Prevents system corruption

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Transaction wrapper implemented
- [ ] Automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] State snapshots before operations
- [ ] Cleanup of partial changes
- [ ] Recovery from interrupted operations
- [ ] Tests for rollback scenarios
