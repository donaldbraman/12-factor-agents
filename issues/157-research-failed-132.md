# Issue #157: Research and Document Current State for Issue #132

## Background
This issue was created by FailureAnalysisAgent to resolve a failed task.

**Original Issue:** #132
**Failed Agent:** issue_fixer_agent
**Failure Reason:** Could not determine how to fix this issue
**Root Cause:** MISSING_CURRENT_STATE
**Difficulty Assessment:** HARD

## Original Task That Failed
# Issue #152: Warning: Invalid Regex Escape Sequences

## Description
Warning: Invalid Regex Escape Sequences

## Task Description  
**Location:** `agents/issue_decomposer_agent.py:70`
**Problem:** SyntaxWarning for invalid escape sequences in regex
**Current:** `"###.*1\.", "###.*2\.", "###.*3\."`
**Solution:** Use raw strings: `r"###.*1\.", r"###.*2\.", r"###.*3\."`

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. *Location:** `agents/issue_decomposer_agent.py:70`
2. *Problem:** Synta...

## Research Required
## Missing Information to Gather
- [ ] Current state/code block
- [ ] Required change/target state
- [ ] Specific location within file

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. Examine the target file to identify current state
2. Document the exact current code/text that needs changing
3. Create clear Current/Required change blocks
4. Specify exact line numbers or function names

## Expected Output
Create a new, more specific issue that the issue_fixer_agent can successfully execute. The new issue should include:

1. **Clear Current State**: Exact code/text that exists now
2. **Specific Target**: Exact code/text that should exist after changes
3. **File Path**: Complete path to file(s) that need modification
4. **Location Details**: Line numbers, function names, or specific sections

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Root cause of failure identified and documented
- [ ] Missing information gathered through research
- [ ] New actionable issue created with complete specifications
- [ ] New issue ready for successful execution by original agent

## Files to Research
- agents/issue_decomposer_agent.py

## Type
research

## Priority
high

## Status
CLOSED

## Resolution Notes
‚ùå **CLOSED AS OBSOLETE** - Research issue no longer needed
- **Original Issue #132** should be addressed directly if still relevant
- Multiple meta-research issues create unnecessary administrative overhead
- **Action**: Focus on concrete issues rather than research about failures
- **Cleanup**: Closing duplicate research issues to streamline workflow  

**Resolution**: Prioritize direct issue resolution over failure analysis
