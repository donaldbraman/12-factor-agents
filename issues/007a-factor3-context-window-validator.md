# Issue #007a: Implement Factor 3 Validator - Own Your Context Window

## Parent Issue
#MASTER-12-FACTOR-COMPLIANCE

## Description
Implement validator for Factor 3: Own Your Context Window. Agents should carefully manage and curate the context provided to language models.

## Validation Criteria
The validator should check:
1. **Context Size Management**
   - Context doesn't exceed reasonable limits
   - Unnecessary information is pruned
   - Critical information is prioritized

2. **Context Structure**
   - Well-organized sections
   - Clear delineation of different context types
   - Proper use of ExecutionContext class

3. **Context Efficiency**
   - No duplicate information
   - Relevant context for the task
   - Historical context appropriately summarized

## Implementation Details
```python
class Factor3Validator(FactorValidator):
    """Factor 3: Own Your Context Window"""
    
    def validate(self, agent: BaseAgent, context: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        # Check for context management methods
        # Validate context size limits
        # Ensure proper context structure
        # Check for context optimization
```
