# Issue #007a: Implement Factor 3 Validator - Own Your Context Window

## Parent Issue
#MASTER-12-FACTOR-COMPLIANCE

## Description
Implement validator for Factor 3: Own Your Context Window. Agents should carefully manage and curate the context provided to language models.

## Validation Criteria
The validator should check:
1. **Context Size Management**
   - Context doesn't exceed reasonable limits
   - Unnecessary information is pruned
   - Critical information is prioritized

2. **Context Structure**
   - Well-organized sections
   - Clear delineation of different context types
   - Proper use of ExecutionContext class

3. **Context Efficiency**
   - No duplicate information
   - Relevant context for the task
   - Historical context appropriately summarized

## Implementation Details
```python
class Factor3Validator(FactorValidator):
    """Factor 3: Own Your Context Window"""
    
    def validate(self, agent: BaseAgent, context: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        # Check for context management methods
        # Validate context size limits
        # Ensure proper context structure
        # Check for context optimization
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- core/compliance.py - Add Factor3Validator class
- core/context_manager.py - Create context management utilities
- tests/test_factor3_compliance.py - Add validation tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Factor3Validator class implemented
- [x] Validates context size limits
- [x] Checks for context optimization
- [x] Provides actionable recommendations
- [x] Tests pass with >90% coverage

## Priority
High - Core compliance requirement

## Type
enhancement

## Status
COMPLETED

## Implementation Details
✅ **COMPLETED** - Factor 3 Validator Implementation
- ✅ Factor3Validator class added to core/compliance.py
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with 4 checks (0.25 points each):
  1. **Context Manager Presence**: Validates proper ContextManager instance with required methods
  2. **Context Size Management**: Checks token limits (reasonable max_tokens) and usage tracking
  3. **Context Structure**: Validates priority-based context management and ExecutionContext support
  4. **Context Optimization**: Ensures cleanup methods (clear, remove_old_context, compact_errors)
- ✅ Validator registered in ComplianceAuditor.__init__
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created with 13 test cases covering all scenarios
- ✅ All tests passing (13/13 test cases)
- ✅ Validated with SmartIssueAgent - achieving FULLY_COMPLIANT status
- ✅ Overall system compliance: 8/12 validators (67% → 75% compliance)

**Progress**: Factor 8 ✅ → Factor 3 ✅ COMPLETED
**Next**: Factor 5 (Unified State) per priority order
