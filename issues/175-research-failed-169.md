## Background
This issue was created by FailureAnalysisAgent to resolve a failed task.

**Original Issue:** #169
**Failed Agent:** testing_agent
**Failure Reason:** Could not determine how to fix this issue
**Root Cause:** MISSING_CURRENT_STATE
**Difficulty Assessment:** HARD

## Original Task That Failed
# Issue #171: Setup Script Creates Broken Instructions

## Description
Setup Script Creates Broken Instructions

## Task Description  
**Location:** setup-new-repo.sh creates test issue that references missing agent
**Current:** Test issue says to run SmartIssueAgent but it doesn't exist
**Impact:** New users immediately hit failure on their first test

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. *Location:** setup-new-repo.sh creates test issue that references missing agent
2. *Cur...

## Research Required
## Missing Information to Gather
- [ ] Current state/code block
- [ ] Required change/target state
- [ ] Specific location within file

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. Examine the target file to identify current state
2. Document the exact current code/text that needs changing
3. Create clear Current/Required change blocks
4. Specify exact line numbers or function names

## Expected Output
Create a new, more specific issue that the testing_agent can successfully execute. The new issue should include:

1. **Clear Current State**: Exact code/text that exists now
2. **Specific Target**: Exact code/text that should exist after changes
3. **File Path**: Complete path to file(s) that need modification
4. **Location Details**: Line numbers, function names, or specific sections

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Root cause of failure identified and documented
- [ ] Missing information gathered through research
- [ ] New actionable issue created with complete specifications
- [ ] New issue ready for successful execution by original agent
