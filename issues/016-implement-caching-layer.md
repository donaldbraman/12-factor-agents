# Issue #016: Implement Caching Layer for Agent Results

## Description
We need a caching layer to store and retrieve agent processing results to avoid redundant computations. This will improve performance and reduce API costs.

## Requirements

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Create `core/cache_manager.py` with CacheManager class
- [ ] Support multiple cache backends (memory, Redis, disk)
- [ ] Implement TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries
- [ ] Add cache key generation based on input hash
- [ ] Include cache invalidation mechanisms

### Features
- [ ] LRU eviction policy when memory cache is full
- [ ] Configurable cache size limits
- [ ] Cache hit/miss statistics tracking
- [ ] Warm-up capability for pre-loading common entries
- [ ] Thread-safe operations

### Integration Points
- [ ] Decorator for caching function results: `@cached(ttl=3600)`
- [ ] Integration with SmartIssueAgent for caching analysis results
- [ ] Cache sharing between agent instances
- [ ] Cache persistence across restarts (for disk/Redis backends)

## Example Usage

```python
from core.cache_manager import CacheManager, cached

# Initialize cache
cache = CacheManager(backend="memory", max_size=1000)

# Use decorator
@cached(ttl=3600, key_prefix="analysis")
def analyze_issue(issue_id: str) -> dict:
    # Expensive computation
    return {"complexity": "high", "estimated_time": 3600}

# Manual cache operations
cache.set("user:123", {"name": "Alice"}, ttl=7200)
user = cache.get("user:123")
cache.invalidate("user:123")
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All cache operations are O(1) for memory backend
- [ ] Redis backend handles connection failures gracefully
- [ ] Cache statistics show hit rate above 50% in tests
- [ ] Thread safety verified with concurrent access tests
- [ ] Documentation includes performance benchmarks
- [ ] Integration tests with SmartIssueAgent pass

## Technical Notes
- Use hashlib for consistent cache key generation
- Consider using pickle for object serialization
- Implement cache warming from previous runs
- Add metrics for monitoring cache effectiveness
