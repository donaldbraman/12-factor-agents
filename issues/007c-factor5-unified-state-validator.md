# Issue #007c: Implement Factor 5 Validator - Unify Execution and Business State

## Parent Issue
#MASTER-12-FACTOR-COMPLIANCE

## Description
Implement validator for Factor 5: Unify Execution and Business State. Agent execution state should be seamlessly integrated with business logic state.

## Validation Criteria
The validator should check:
1. **State Unification**
   - No separate execution/business state stores
   - Single source of truth for state
   - State accessible through consistent interface

2. **State Management**
   - Clear state transitions
   - State persistence mechanisms
   - State recovery capabilities

3. **State Visibility**
   - State observable and queryable
   - Audit trail for state changes
   - State debugging capabilities

## Implementation Details
```python
class Factor5Validator(FactorValidator):
    """Factor 5: Unify Execution and Business State"""
    
    def validate(self, agent: BaseAgent, context: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        # Check for unified state management
        # Validate state transition logic
        # Ensure state persistence
        # Check state observability
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- core/compliance.py - Add Factor5Validator class
- core/unified_state.py - Create unified state manager
- tests/test_factor5_compliance.py - Add validation tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Factor5Validator class implemented
- [x] Validates unified state management
- [x] Checks state persistence
- [x] Ensures state observability
- [x] Tests pass with >90% coverage

## Priority
Medium - Important for complex workflows

## Type
enhancement

## Status
COMPLETED

## Implementation Details
✅ **COMPLETED** - Factor 5 Validator Implementation
- ✅ Factor5Validator class added to core/compliance.py
- ✅ Comprehensive validation with 4 checks (0.25 points each):
  1. **Unified State Presence**: Validates UnifiedState instance with required methods and attributes
  2. **State Management**: Checks history tracking and ToolResponse update mechanism
  3. **State Persistence**: Validates serialization methods and checkpoint integration
  4. **State Observability**: Ensures get_summary(), history access, and status integration
- ✅ Validator registered in ComplianceAuditor.__init__
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created with 14 test cases covering all scenarios
- ✅ All tests passing (14/14 test cases)
- ✅ Validated with SmartIssueAgent - achieving FULLY_COMPLIANT status
- ✅ Overall system compliance: 9/12 validators (75% → 83% compliance)

**Progress**: Factor 3 ✅ → Factor 5 ✅ COMPLETED
**Next**: Factor 7 (Human Interaction) per priority order
