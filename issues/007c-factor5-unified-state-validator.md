# Issue #007c: Implement Factor 5 Validator - Unify Execution and Business State

## Parent Issue
#MASTER-12-FACTOR-COMPLIANCE

## Description
Implement validator for Factor 5: Unify Execution and Business State. Agent execution state should be seamlessly integrated with business logic state.

## Validation Criteria
The validator should check:
1. **State Unification**
   - No separate execution/business state stores
   - Single source of truth for state
   - State accessible through consistent interface

2. **State Management**
   - Clear state transitions
   - State persistence mechanisms
   - State recovery capabilities

3. **State Visibility**
   - State observable and queryable
   - Audit trail for state changes
   - State debugging capabilities

## Implementation Details
```python
class Factor5Validator(FactorValidator):
    """Factor 5: Unify Execution and Business State"""
    
    def validate(self, agent: BaseAgent, context: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        # Check for unified state management
        # Validate state transition logic
        # Ensure state persistence
        # Check state observability
```

## Files to Create/Modify
