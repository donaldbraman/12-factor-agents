## Background
This issue was created by FailureAnalysisAgent to resolve a failed task.

**Original Issue:** #132
**Failed Agent:** testing_agent
**Failure Reason:** Could not determine how to fix this issue
**Root Cause:** MISSING_CURRENT_STATE
**Difficulty Assessment:** HARD

## Original Task That Failed
# Issue #153: Critical: Pytest Suite Failing

## Description
Critical: Pytest Suite Failing

## Task Description  
**Location:** `tests/` directory
**Problem:** Pytest suite returns failure status
**Need:** Investigate specific test failures and fix root causes

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. *Location:** `tests/` directory
2. *Problem:** Pytest suite returns failure status
3. *Need:** Investigate specific test failures and fix root causes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] I...

## Research Required
## Missing Information to Gather
- [ ] Current state/code block
- [ ] Required change/target state
- [ ] Specific target file path
- [ ] Specific location within file

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. Examine the target file to identify current state
2. Document the exact current code/text that needs changing
3. Create clear Current/Required change blocks
4. Specify exact line numbers or function names

## Expected Output
Create a new, more specific issue that the testing_agent can successfully execute. The new issue should include:

1. **Clear Current State**: Exact code/text that exists now
2. **Specific Target**: Exact code/text that should exist after changes
3. **File Path**: Complete path to file(s) that need modification
4. **Location Details**: Line numbers, function names, or specific sections

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Root cause of failure identified and documented
- [ ] Missing information gathered through research
- [ ] New actionable issue created with complete specifications
- [ ] New issue ready for successful execution by original agent
