# Issue #096: Enhance agent handling of new feature requests

## Problem
When sister repositories submit issues for new features (not bug fixes to existing code), the IntelligentIssueAgent correctly identifies there are no files to fix but doesn't create the new feature implementation. This happened with cite-assist issue #122 for "sentence-boundary chunking feature".

## Current Behavior
- Agent analyzes the issue
- Looks for existing files mentioned in the issue
- Finds no files to fix
- Returns "No modifications made for issue #X"
- Correctly notes "This could mean the issue was already resolved or needs manual attention"

## Desired Behavior
- Agent should detect when an issue is requesting a new feature
- Should scaffold appropriate new files based on the feature description
- Should implement basic structure for the feature
- Should follow project conventions and patterns

## Implementation Strategy
1. Add feature detection logic to `_determine_strategy()` method
2. Create new strategy: `_create_new_feature()`
3. Implement scaffolding logic that:
   - Analyzes feature requirements
   - Determines appropriate file structure
   - Creates initial implementation
   - Follows project patterns

## Example Case
cite-assist issue #122 requested "sentence-boundary chunking feature" which would require:
- New module for sentence boundary detection
- Integration with existing chunking system
- Tests for the new functionality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent can detect new feature requests vs bug fixes
- [ ] Agent creates appropriate new files for features
- [ ] Agent follows project conventions when creating files
- [ ] Agent provides meaningful initial implementation
- [ ] Works correctly for sister repository submissions

## Priority
High - This affects sister repository integration and limits agent usefulness for feature development
