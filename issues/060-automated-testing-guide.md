# Issue #060: Create automated testing for Integration Guide examples

## Description
We need automated testing to ensure all code examples in the Integration Guide remain functional.

## Current Issues
- Manual testing revealed several broken examples
- No CI/CD validation of documentation code
- Examples can break when core framework changes

## Proposed Solution
1. Create `tests/test_integration_guide.py` that:
   - Extracts all code blocks from the guide
   - Runs each example in isolation
   - Validates expected outputs

2. Add to CI pipeline:
   - Run on every PR that touches docs/
   - Run weekly to catch framework drift

3. Benefits:
   - Ensures documentation stays accurate
   - Catches breaking changes early
   - Improves developer trust in examples

## Type
