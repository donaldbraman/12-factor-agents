# MASTER ISSUE: Achieve Full 12-Factor Compliance

## Overview
Systematic implementation of all 12-factor principles for agent systems. Current compliance: ~42%. Target: 100%.

## Current Status by Factor

### ✅ Implemented (4/12)
- **Factor 1**: Natural Language to Tool Calls (validator exists)
- **Factor 2**: Own Your Prompts (validator exists, needs enforcement)
- **Factor 6**: Launch/Pause/Resume with Simple APIs (validator exists)
- **Factor 10**: Small, Focused Agents (validator exists, needs enforcement)

### ❌ Not Implemented (8/12)
- **Factor 3**: Own Your Context Window
- **Factor 4**: Tools are Structured Outputs
- **Factor 5**: Unify Execution and Business State
- **Factor 7**: Contact Humans with Tool Calls
- **Factor 8**: Own Your Control Flow
- **Factor 9**: Compact Errors into Context Window
- **Factor 11**: Trigger from Anywhere
- **Factor 12**: Stateless Reducer

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Priority: CRITICAL)
Focus on foundational validators and standardization.

**Issues:**
- [ ] #007: Implement missing factor validators
- [ ] #010: Standardize tool response structure
- [ ] #012: Add stateless validation

**Deliverables:**
- All 12 validators implemented in core/compliance.py
- Standardized ToolResponse across all tools
- @stateless decorator for validation

### Phase 2: Refactoring (Priority: HIGH)
Clean up existing violations and improve compliance.

**Issues:**
- [ ] #008: Externalize hardcoded prompts
- [ ] #009: Improve error compaction
- [ ] #011: Split large agents

**Deliverables:**
- All prompts in prompts/ directory
- Error compaction utility
- No agent >200 lines

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Priority: MEDIUM)
Add advanced features and optimizations.

**New Issues to Create:**
- [ ] #013: Implement context window management
- [ ] #014: Add human contact tools
- [ ] #015: Create trigger registry
- [ ] #016: Build state unification layer

**Deliverables:**
- Context window optimizer
- Human interaction framework
- Universal trigger system
- Unified state management

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (Priority: LOW)
Ensure compliance and document patterns.

**New Issues to Create:**
- [ ] #017: Create compliance dashboard
- [ ] #018: Write 12-factor best practices guide
- [ ] #019: Add compliance CI checks
- [ ] #020: Generate compliance reports

**Deliverables:**
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Developer documentation
- Automated compliance testing
- Regular compliance reports

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 12 validators implemented
- [ ] 100% of agents pass validation
- [ ] Zero hardcoded prompts
- [ ] All tools return ToolResponse
- [ ] No agent exceeds 200 lines
- [ ] All errors compacted
- [ ] Stateless validation enforced
- [ ] CI/CD compliance checks passing
