# Issue #177: Clarify Requirements for Issue #169

## Background
This issue was created by FailureAnalysisAgent to resolve a failed task.

**Original Issue:** #169
**Failed Agent:** testing_agent
**Failure Reason:** Could not determine how to fix this issue
**Root Cause:** VAGUE_REQUIREMENTS
**Difficulty Assessment:** MODERATE

## Original Task That Failed
# Issue #173: Guide Documentation Mismatch

## Description
Guide Documentation Mismatch

## Task Description  
**Location:** Guide examples throughout assume agents exist
**Current:** All SmartIssueAgent examples will fail
**Impact:** Complete guide is unusable for actual new repositories

## Root Cause
The new agent system (SmartIssueAgent, IssueDecomposerAgent, FailureAnalysisAgent, etc.) exists locally but was never committed/pushed to the remote repository that submodules reference.

## Requ...

## Research Required
## Missing Information to Gather
- [ ] Current state/code block
- [ ] Required change/target state
- [ ] Specific location within file

## Actionable Steps (Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow)
1. Break down the vague requirement into specific actions
2. Identify concrete, measurable outcomes
3. Create step-by-step implementation plan
4. Define clear success criteria

## Expected Output
Create a new, more specific issue that the testing_agent can successfully execute. The new issue should include:

1. **Clear Current State**: Exact code/text that exists now
2. **Specific Target**: Exact code/text that should exist after changes
3. **File Path**: Complete path to file(s) that need modification
4. **Location Details**: Line numbers, function names, or specific sections

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Root cause of failure identified and documented
- [ ] Missing information gathered through research
- [ ] New actionable issue created with complete specifications
- [ ] New issue ready for successful execution by original agent

## Files to Research
- NEW-REPO-GUIDE.md
- setup-new-repo.sh
