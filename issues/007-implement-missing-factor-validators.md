# Issue #007: Implement Missing Factor Validators

## Description
The compliance.py module only has validators for factors 1, 2, 6, and 10. We need validators for the remaining 8 factors.

## Missing Validators
- Factor 3: Own Your Context Window
- Factor 4: Tools are Structured Outputs  
- Factor 5: Unify Execution and Business State
- Factor 7: Contact Humans with Tool Calls
- Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow
- Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window
- Factor 11: Trigger from Anywhere
- Factor 12: Stateless Reducer

## Implementation
Each validator should:
- Extend FactorValidator base class
- Check specific compliance criteria
- Return ComplianceLevel and validation details
- Include actionable recommendations

## Priority
High - Core compliance infrastructure

## Type
enhancement
