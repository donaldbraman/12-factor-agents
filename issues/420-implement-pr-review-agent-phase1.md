# Issue #420: Implement PR Review Agent - Phase 1 Foundation

## Description

Create the foundational PR Review Agent for the 12-factor-agents system that can automatically review GitHub pull requests. This Phase 1 implementation focuses on core functionality: fetching PR data, analyzing code changes with LLM, and posting review comments back to GitHub.

## Objectives

1. Create a new `PRReviewAgent` class that follows 12-factor methodology
2. Implement GitHub API integration for PR operations
3. Add LLM-powered code review capabilities
4. Enable basic review comment posting
5. Generate enhanced PR descriptions

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Agent Structure (`agents/pr_review_agent.py`)

Create a new agent with the following structure:

```python
class PRReviewAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Automated PR review agent for GitHub pull requests.
    Provides AI-powered code analysis, suggestions, and feedback.
    """
    
    def register_tools(self) -> List[Tool]:
        return [
            FetchPRTool(),
            AnalyzeCodeTool(), 
            PostCommentTool(),
            UpdatePRDescriptionTool()
        ]
    
    def execute_task(self, task: str) -> ToolResponse:
        # Parse task to extract PR number and repo
        # Fetch PR diff
        # Analyze with LLM
        # Post results
        pass
```

### 2. Tool Implementations

#### FetchPRTool
- Use GitHub API to retrieve PR details
- Get the diff/patch data
- Extract file changes
- Handle authentication via environment variables

#### AnalyzeCodeTool  
- Construct optimized prompt with:
  - Coding guidelines from `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
  - PR diff content
  - Project context
- Call LLM API (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Parse structured response

#### PostCommentTool
- Post general PR review comment
- Add line-specific comments where needed
- Handle GitHub API rate limits

#### UpdatePRDescriptionTool
- Generate concise PR summary from changes
- Update PR body with enhanced description
- Maintain original author content

### 3. Configuration

Create `config/pr_review_config.json`:
```json
{
  "github_token": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
  "llm_provider": "openai",
  "llm_model": "gpt-4",
  "review_prompt_template": "prompts/pr_review.prompt",
  "max_diff_size": 5000,
  "review_depth": "standard",
  "include_suggestions": true,
  "check_documentation": true
}
```

### 4. Prompt Engineering

Create `prompts/pr_review.prompt`:
```
You are a senior code reviewer for the 12-factor-agents project.

Project Context:
- Python-based agent orchestration system  
- Follows 12-factor methodology
- Emphasizes modularity, reusability, and clean architecture

Review Guidelines:
{guidelines}

PR Diff:
{diff}

Instructions:
1. Provide a concise summary (1 paragraph)
2. Check for bugs, security issues, performance problems
3. Verify code follows project patterns
4. Suggest specific improvements
5. Rate overall quality (1-10)

Output as JSON with sections: summary, issues, suggestions, quality_score
```

### 5. Integration Points

- Must inherit from `BaseAgent` 
- Follow existing tool patterns from `core/tools.py`
- Use `ToolResponse` for all returns
- Support checkpoint/resume via base class
- Compatible with IssueOrchestratorAgent dispatching

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create agent file**: `agents/pr_review_agent.py`
2. **Implement FetchPRTool**: GitHub API integration
3. **Implement AnalyzeCodeTool**: LLM integration
4. **Implement PostCommentTool**: Comment posting
5. **Add configuration**: Config files and prompts
6. **Write tests**: `tests/test_pr_review_agent.py`
7. **Add documentation**: Update README and guides

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each tool
- Integration test with mock GitHub API
- Test with real PR (non-destructive)
- Verify prompt effectiveness
- Check error handling

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Agent can fetch PR data from GitHub
- [ ] Agent analyzes code and generates meaningful feedback
- [ ] Agent posts comments back to PR
- [ ] Agent handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Agent follows 12-factor patterns
- [ ] Tests pass with >80% coverage

## Dependencies

- PyGithub or github3.py for GitHub API
- OpenAI or Anthropic SDK for LLM
- Existing BaseAgent infrastructure
- Environment variables for secrets

## Agent Assignment

IntelligentIssueAgent

## Priority

High

## Estimated Effort

1 week for core implementation

## Notes

This is Phase 1 of a 4-phase plan to build a comprehensive PR review system. Future phases will add:
- Phase 2: Webhook integration and automation
- Phase 3: Static analysis and security scanning
- Phase 4: RAG-based context awareness

The agent should be designed with extensibility in mind to support these future enhancements.
