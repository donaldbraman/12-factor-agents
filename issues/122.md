- 📝 Recommendations generated: 3

## 🚨 Failure Patterns Detected

### routing_mismatch
- **Failure rate**: 100.0%
- **Occurrences**: 118
- **Suggested fix**: Improve agent routing logic to respect recommendations

### parameter_mismatch
- **Failure rate**: 100.0%
- **Occurrences**: 30
- **Suggested fix**: Update method signatures to match calling patterns

### method_signature_error
- **Failure rate**: 100.0%
- **Occurrences**: 18
- **Suggested fix**: Fix method signatures to accept execution_state_id

## 📝 Actionable Recommendations

1. AVOID: routing_mismatch (fails 100% of the time)
2. AVOID: parameter_mismatch (fails 100% of the time)
