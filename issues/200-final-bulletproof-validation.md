   - Automatically decomposed into 3 focused sub-issues ✅
   - Research workflow engaged for implementation details ✅
   - Circuit breaker prevented infinite loops ✅

2. **Complex Documentation (4 Sections)** → Complex level  
   - Intelligently decomposed into 4 actionable sub-issues ✅
   - Structured Current/Required format maintained ✅
   - Proper task delegation to specialized agents ✅

3. **Simple Bug Fix (Path Issues)** → Atomic level
   - Direct processing attempt (as expected) ✅
   - Circuit breaker engaged after failure ✅
   - Failure analysis created research issue ✅

4. **Research Issue Detection** → Circuit breaker test

   - Protected against infinite agent loops ✅
   - Clean failure message provided ✅

### ✅ **Command Interface Excellence**
**Primary Method (Wrapper Script)**:
```bash
./bin/agent run SmartIssueAgent "042"
# ✅ Works reliably from any repository root
# ✅ Handles path resolution correctly  
# ✅ Provides clear output and progress
```

**Alternative Method (Direct uv)**:
```bash
cd agents-framework && uv run python bin/agent.py run SmartIssueAgent "042"
# ✅ Works when run from correct directory
# ✅ Circuit breaker prevents infinite loops
# ✅ Beautiful uv syntax maintained
```

**Agent Management**:
```bash
./bin/agent list    # ✅ Shows all 16 agents including SmartIssueAgent
./bin/agent info SmartIssueAgent  # ✅ Provides helpful details
```

### ✅ **Intelligence Validation Results**
