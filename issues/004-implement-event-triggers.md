## Description
Create a local event trigger system to achieve 100% compliance with Factor 11: Trigger from Anywhere.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Implementation Requirements
```python
class LocalEventSystem:
    def emit(self, event: str, data: Dict)

    def process_events(self)
    def register_file_watcher(self, path: str, pattern: str)
    def register_schedule(self, cron: str, handler: Callable)
```
