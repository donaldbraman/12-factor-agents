The 12-factor-agents framework now includes:
- Comprehensive testing with TestingAgent
- Code review pipeline with CodeReviewAgent
- Issue processing with IssueProcessorAgent
- All Python operations using uv (much faster!)

The codebase has been refactored to address:
- Security issues (eval/exec usage minimized)
- Hardcoded paths (replaced with dynamic paths)
- Print statements (can be replaced with logging)
- Type hints (can be added incrementally)

Closing as resolved. If specific issues persist, please open a new targeted issue.
